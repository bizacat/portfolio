            <h2>Who</h2>
            <p>
                mobi is a Software as a Service (SaaS) developer for service and delivery businesses that operate fleets of vehicles. mobi provides a suite of applications ranging from GPS tracking, route optimization, to analytics to help manage and improve operations for these industries.
            </p>
            <h2>What</h2>
            <p>
                The existing website has a lot of valuable information on it, a separate page for every product and all of the solutions, many benefits, a blog, a knowledge center, and much more content.
            </p>
            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>
                There are too many choices and information overload. Much of the information remains outdated and the organic traffic to the site is followed by a high bounce rate and little retention. mobi also developed more refined sales and marketing strategies in other areas of the company and so it makes sense to reflect this in their website.

            <h2>Identifying the problem</h2>
            <h4>Identifying that there is a problem</h4>
            <p>
                We long knew there were issues with the current website– one of the biggest obstacles we have yet to overcome is clearly conveying the who and the what (and the why) of mobi. The site receives little traffic, which stems from other issues such as poor SEO, indexing, lack of marketing campaigns, external driving forces from salespeople in the field, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, using google analytics we also understood that there was a
                <strong>very high bounce rate</strong> and the few who did interact with the website for any other reason than to go straight
                to the about/careers/management pages <strong>were not following any channels that we want them to</strong>
                (fill out a form for a free demo or a quote/OSA).
            </p>
            <p>
                There were loosely defined goals we knew we wanted fulfilled but had neglected to outline a direct path towards how that is to be achieved from an organic experience (no salesperson leading the way for the user).

            <h2>Presenting the case for change</h2>
            <h4>Taking stock of the quantitative and qualitative data</h4>
            <p>
                In order to quickly gather anonymous feedback from those who were unfamiliar with mobi, I used Usability Hub's 5 second
                test to interview users for their first impression with the old website. Shortly after I created the first draft of the new
                landing page I repeated the test to see how the audience responded to the updated information. This data helped serve as a
                simple but powerful guide in <strong>reaffirming the correct direction to take the redesign</strong>, as well as
                <strong>key evidence to suggest a need for change.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                We also conducted 3 video recordings using <a href="http://peek.usertesting.com">Peek</a> to get deeper insight into how new users interacted with the brand and the
                website.

                <ul>
                    <li>The hero image has no representation of what mobi does</li>
                    <li>The video release (see the show) is 2 years old and has unclear interactive intentions with unknown consequences</li>
                    <li>No supportive text or headlines that tells us exactly what mobi is or provides without confusing jargon</li>
                    <li>Too many options in the navigation and within the content, leading to overchoice or choice paralysis.</li>
                    <li>No clear call to action or obvious next steps.</li>
                    <li>Content breadth is extremely large and takes some scanning (and patience) to get the gist of mobi</li>
                    <li>User feedback studies resulted in many responses indicating that they thought mobi dealt with data, streaming, video, or other unrelated services</li>

                    <li>One person who was video interviewed skimmed the benefits in search of what mobi is all about and honed in on the particular benefit “Manage your fleet. Monitor drivers and manage assignments” concluding that the company deals with fleets of vehicles</li>
                    <li>Another interviewee saw the screenshots and understood that mobi deals with maps (but thought mobi was just a mapping/routing company)</li>
                    <li>Yet another interviewee scrolled all the way to the bottom and clicked on one of the videos that had nothing to do with mobi, but was evidence that they were more likely to play a video easily accessible from the webiste (as opposed to the hidden American Dream videos).</li>

            <h2>The top fold: Making the seconds count</h2>
            <h4>No room for fluff</h4>

            <span class="caption">The content immediately below the top fold</span>
            <p>
                The number one task that needed to be addressed was the first thing a new visitor sees– the hero image, the headline, the most important call to action (CTA), and clean navigation.
            </p>
            <h3>The hero image</h3>
            <p>
                Captures the visual nature of mobi's services. Serves as an eye-catching device to draw attention and keep it. An asymmetric weight of the image helps frame the next key information appropriately.
            </p>
            <h3>The key information (headline and subheadline)</h3>
            <p>
                Explains exactly what mobi is. No fluff.
            </p>
            <h3>The clean navigation</h3>
            <p>
                Previously, there were 9 options in the navigation. With dropdowns, there were 46 options. Now there are are 4 main options for new users, an additional navigation menu that is separate and clearly related to existing users' needs.

            <span class="caption">Less main navigation options with more defined sub-link descriptions helps users make a more informed and quicker decision</span>
            <h3>The CTA</h3>
            <p>
                So the user sees some cool videos or reads a quick blurb about the company– now what? Now there's a direct link to the request a demo form at the bottom of the page.
