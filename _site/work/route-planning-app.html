            <h2>Who</h2>
            <p>
                mobi is a Software as a Service (SaaS) developer for service and delivery businesses that operate fleets of vehicles. mobi provides a suite of applications ranging from GPS tracking, route optimization, to analytics to help manage and improve operations for these industries.
            </p>
            <h2>What</h2>
            <p>
                Of the 10 web-based applications that serves every phase of the [fleet] business cycle, two involve the planning of driver routes. One
                involves multi-day planning (mobi.Plan) typically used by the largest enterprise customers with hundreds and thousands of vehicles and branches
                to operate. This case study covers mobi.Route, which focuses on daily planning– at most covering plans up to a week out.
            </p>
            <p>
                An existing application was massive, complex, and difficult to update due to a combination of out-dated
                technology and tricky interlaced dependencies that made for a very fragile internal ecosystem. It was also very challenging to operate,
                had a large learning curve, and required a dedicated team of mobi's employees to frequently assist their main users in navigating the app.
            </p>
            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>
                The main reasons for wanting to rebuild mobi.Route were to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>recreate the APIs and back-end from the ground up</li>
                <li>improve the usability of the tool</li>
                <li>add new features that would make router's lives easier</li>
                <li>streamline interactions both within and across applications</li>
                <li>update the UI to remain consistent with other newer mobi products</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The research</h2>
            <p>
                Before starting on planning for this project, I was fortunate enough to be able to visit one of mobi's customers, a
                large telecom service company in Illinois.  For two days I had the chance to sit down with several of their routers and dispatchers
                using the original versions of mobi.Route and mobi.Dispatch, ask questions, observe, and gather as much valuable insight
                and feedback as I could. I documented much of it <a href="/portfolio/work/ethnographic-research">in this case study</a> on ethnographic research.
            </p>
            <h3>A summary of my findings:</h3>
            <h5>The good</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The colorful schedule boards were heavily utilized for getting <strong>at-a-glance information about the day quickly</strong></li>
                <li>
                    Users were <strong>able to check for poorly distributed work across</strong> resources (drivers) or gaps in their schedules that
                    could be filled with new jobs
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>On-time arrival percentages</strong> were one of the most critical metrics to evaluate performance for a daily plan (this company
                    insisted on achieving at least 97.0% OTA)
                </li>
                <li>It was helpful to have an <strong>easily accessible list of all assigned and unassigned jobs</strong>, along with their metrics, specifications, and addresses</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>The bad</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No ability to filter or sort</strong> the schedule board (specifically mentioned by a router)</li>
                <li>
                    Each user had 3 separate monitors with different windows open, some of which were supplemental internal tools to assist them
                    with tasks that <strong>mobi.Route did not have features for</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    When a user wanted to make a change to anything within the plan (resource information, job details, availability, assignments, etc.),
                    entirely new tabs had to be opened (see above screenshots for example– Planning and Configuration Tabs).  There is <strong>no direct linking or
                    flow in between tasks</strong>, so users were having to copy and paste or check multiple screens to type in names and ID numbers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A very outdated and nearly <strong>unusable map</strong> that is almost not worth mentioning and never used
                </li>
                <li>
                    When assigning or reassigning a job to a resource, the user has <strong>no indication of geographical proximity</strong> between resource or job without
                    clicking on each individually and reading the address. Context is lost.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the list view showing all draft and committed plans for a day (and other days), <strong>key metrics like on-time arrival aren't displayed</strong>, so users
                    must click and load each plan to check the value.
                </li>
                <li>Plan refreshing/processing progress was unclear, leading to <strong>a lot of page refreshing</strong> while waiting for changes to update</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>The interesting</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Users were <strong>adding labels to a resource's name field</strong> (unexpected use case to fill an unmet need) so they could quickly
                    see what skill sets each resource was capable of
                </li>
                <li>
                    No matter how late a job was (30 seconds or 30 minutes), it would equally impact the on-time arrival percentage greatly, so users
                    were <strong>manually editing (fudging) job lengths or tech abilities</strong> so they could fit in without going outside of a time window.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It was <strong>unclear what occurred when the system automatically made changes</strong> to a plan due to resource and job updates happening in
                    real-time, and new plans that they themselves chose to run with new configurations. This led to multiple hypotheses without clear data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users liked being able to see when and by who a plan was created or modified, but they also <strong>wanted to know what changed</strong>. Many
                    would use the plan name field to also add details about what was new in the plan (ex: July 10 - SO29503110 reassignment)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                That was a lot to take in! But the feedback I got on that trip was invaluable and helped us get a kickstart on where to go with the new mobi.Route
